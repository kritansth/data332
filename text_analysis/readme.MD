## Data Dictionary
The dataset consists of consumer complaints from various industries.  
### Columns Used:
1. **Consumer.complaint.narrative** â€“ The raw text of consumer complaints.

---

## Data Cleaning
The raw data underwent the following preprocessing steps to ensure consistency and relevance:  
1. **Removed missing values** â€“Removed rows with missing or empty complaint narratives.  
```r
df_clean <- df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Consumer.complaint.narrative) & Consumer.complaint.narrative != "")
```
2. **Text Standardization** â€“ Removed punctuation, numbers and trimmed extra whitespace. 
```r
df_clean$Consumer.complaint.narrative <- df_clean$Consumer.complaint.narrative %>% 
  str_replace_all("[[:punct:]]", "") %>%  
  str_replace_all("[[:digit:]]", "") %>%  
  str_squish()
```
3. **Removed stopwords** â€“ Eliminated common English stopwords (e.g., "the", "and").
```r
df_clean <- df_clean %>% 
  mutate(Consumer.complaint.narrative = removeWords(Consumer.complaint.narrative, stop_words$word))
```
4. **Tokenization** â€“ Split complaints into individual words for analysis.
```r
df_tokens <- df_clean %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, Consumer.complaint.narrative)
```

5. **Filtered unwanted placeholders: Removed placeholder terms like "XXXX".)**.
```r
df_tokens <- df_tokens %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(word, "^x+$"))
```
