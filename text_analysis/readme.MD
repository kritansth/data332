### Columns Used:
1. **Consumer.complaint.narrative** â€“ The raw text of consumer complaints.

## Data Cleaning
We cleaned the data to ensure accurate analysis:
1. **Removed missing values** â€“ Ensured only complaints with text are used.
2. **Lowercased text & removed punctuation** â€“ Standardized format.
3. **Removed stopwords** â€“ Focused on meaningful words.
4. **Tokenized text** â€“ Broke complaints into individual words.
5. **Filtered unwanted placeholders (e.g., "XXXX")**.

```r
df_clean <- df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Consumer.complaint.narrative) & Consumer.complaint.narrative != "") %>% 
  select(Consumer.complaint.narrative)
